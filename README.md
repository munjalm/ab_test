This is a simple PHP CLI script that interacts with users on the Command Prompt. 


## The Problem ##

The Problem
You have joined a science project as the latest team member. Scientists on the project
are running a series of experiments and need to calculate the number of full days
elapsed in between the experiment’s start and end dates, i.e. the first and the last day
are considered partial days and never counted.
Following this logic, an experiment that has run from 07/11/1972 and 08/11/1972
should return 0, because there are no fully elapsed days contained in between those
dates, and 01/01/2000 to 03/01/2000 should return 1.
The solution needs to cater for all valid dates between 01/01/1901 and 31/12/2999. As
the new person on the team, you are tasked with the job.
The scientists are using an older, command-line based system and need at least one way
of providing input and output on the terminal- they’re asking you to build the system
accordingly. They also don’t just take your word for it when it comes to saying, “I’m
done”, they want proof. It turns out they have designed the job as an experiment and

given you a few test cases to pass and validate the output of your program.

Test Cases (DD/MM/YYYY)
1. 02/06/1983 - 22/06/1983: 19 days
2. 04/07/1984 - 25/12/1984: 173 days
3. 03/01/1989 - 03/08/1983: 1979 days


## How to use ##

* Install the script (ab_test.php) on a location in the computer.
* Open the command prompt, and make sure PHP is installed on the computer, by using the command `php -v`
* Navigate to the folder where the script is stored.
* Execute the script by typing in the command `php ab_test.php`
